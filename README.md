## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. You will need to submit a Jupyter notebook for the same. 
## What is the background of your project?
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
- The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. 
- They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
## What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
- The company needs to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
- They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions

1. **Temperature (temp)**: Temperature has the most significant positive impact on bike rental demand. As the temperature rises, the demand for bike rentals increases significantly.

2. **Year (yr)**: The year has a positive impact on demand. Over time, there has been an increasing trend in bike rentals.

3. **Winter Season (winter)**: The winter season is associated with increased demand, possibly due to recreational winter activities and holidays.

4. **September (Sep)**: The month of September has a positive influence on demand, indicating higher rentals during this month.

5. **Saturday (Sat)**: Saturdays show a positive impact on demand, suggesting that weekends attract more customers.

6. **Working Day (workingday)**: Working days also have a positive impact on demand, indicating that bikes are in demand for commuting during weekdays.

7. **Mist (Mist)**: Misty weather conditions have a negative impact on demand, with fewer rentals during misty days.

8. **December (Dec)**: December has a negative impact on demand, possibly due to colder weather and holidays.

9. **November (Nov)**: November also shows a negative influence on demand, likely because of decreasing temperatures.

10. **Windspeed (windspeed)**: Windspeed has a negative impact on demand. Strong winds are associated with lower bike rental
